# Email Copy Template

## Format
Generate an outbound email paragraph that could be embedded in a prospecting or nurture email.

## Structure

### Subject Line Option
[5-10 words. Pain-focused, not product-focused. Should feel like a peer sharing something useful, not a vendor pitching.]

### Opening Line
[1 sentence. Shows understanding of the recipient's world. NOT "I hope this email finds you well."]

### Pain & Context
[2-3 sentences describing the specific pain with practitioner language. Reference what you've heard from similar practitioners.]

### The Insight
[2-3 sentences sharing a specific approach or capability that addresses the pain. Frame as sharing something useful, not selling. Include enough specificity to be credible.]

### Soft CTA
[1 sentence. Low-commitment ask. "Curious if this matches what you're seeing?" or "Happy to share what we've learned."]

## Rules
- Total length: 100-150 words (short email, not a novel)
- NEVER open with "I", open with "you" or the recipient's context
- Sound like a helpful peer, not a sales rep
- The email should be useful even if the reader never responds
- No: "I'd love to pick your brain", "Can I get 15 minutes?", "Just following up"
