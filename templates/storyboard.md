# Storyboard — Multi-Act Transformation Story

Generate a transformation storyboard with **2 length variants in a single output**. Each variant must stand alone as a complete, self-contained piece. Mark each variant clearly.

This is strategic storytelling — the status quo is the villain, the product is the enabler (not the hero), and the customer's world is what transforms.

## VARIANT 1: Short Storyboard (~800-1000 words)

**Purpose**: Executive presentations, pitch decks, quick-read overviews.

Condensed 3-act structure — one tight paragraph per beat:

### Act 1 — The Broken World (2-3 paragraphs)
The status quo villain + human cost. Name the broken thing everyone accepts. Make the abstract pain concrete and personal. Vivid but concise.

### Act 2 — The Turning Point (1-2 paragraphs)
The contrarian insight that changes everything + what becomes possible when you think differently. Product enters as enabler, not hero.

### Act 3 — The New World (1-2 paragraphs)
Concrete before/after for the same scenarios from Act 1. Same person, completely different experience.

### Story Spine
Single standalone paragraph (3-5 sentences) using: *"Once upon a time... Every day... Until one day... Because of that... And ever since..."*

### Taglines
3-5 sticky, memorable phrases that capture the transformation.

Tone: Punchy, every sentence earns its place. A reader should get the full emotional arc in 4 minutes.

## VARIANT 2: Full Storyboard (~2000-2500 words)

**Purpose**: Long-form content, keynotes, detailed positioning documents.

Full 3-act structure with 7 scenes:

### ACT 1: THE WORLD AS IT IS (~800 words)

Emotion: frustration, recognition. The reader should nod and think "that's exactly my life."

- **Scene 1 (Status Quo Villain)**: Name the broken thing everyone accepts but shouldn't. Don't attack a specific competitor — attack the *approach* the industry has normalized.
- **Scene 2 (Human Cost)**: Make abstract pain concrete and personal. Show what this costs real people — their time, sleep, credibility. Use specific scenarios.
- **Scene 3 (Failed Attempts)**: Show why the problem persists despite previous attempts. Half-measures, bolt-on fixes, "next-gen" promises. The problem is *structural*.

### ACT 2: THE TURNING POINT (~600 words)

Emotion: hope, excitement. The reader should lean forward.

- **Scene 4 (The Insight)**: The contrarian reframe — a question that changes everything. "What if the problem isn't that we need better X, but that we've been doing X wrong entirely?"
- **Scene 5 (A Different Approach)**: What follows logically from the insight. The product enters as the natural consequence of thinking differently.

### ACT 3: THE NEW WORLD (~600 words)

Emotion: excitement, aspiration. The reader should feel the pull of possibility.

- **Scene 6 (The Transformation)**: Concrete before/after for the same scenarios from Act 1. Same person, completely different experience.
- **Scene 7 (The Invitation)**: Forward-looking vision. Not a sales pitch — a movement. The reader should feel invited into something bigger.

### STORY SPINE

Single standalone paragraph (3-5 sentences): *"Once upon a time... Every day... Until one day... Because of that... And ever since..."*

### TAGLINES

5-8 sticky, memorable phrases. Mix styles: bold declarations, contrast pairs, reframing questions, movement invitations, provocative challenges.

## Rules

1. Each variant MUST be standalone — use headers: `# VARIANT 1: Short Storyboard`, `# VARIANT 2: Full Storyboard`
2. **Status quo is the villain** — never attack a specific competitor by name. Attack the *approach*.
3. **Product is enabler, not hero** — the customer's world transforms. The product made it possible.
4. **Emotional beats are required** — each act creates a distinct state (frustration → hope → excitement).
5. **Practitioner quotes ground the story** — weave them naturally, especially in Acts 1 and 3.
6. **Every scene advances the narrative** — no filler, no recap. Forward momentum only.
7. **Concrete over abstract** — specific scenarios, real numbers, named roles, actual workflows.
8. No meta-commentary between variants — just the content.
