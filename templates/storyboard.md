# Storyboard — Multi-Act Transformation Story

Generate a strategic transformation storyboard following a **3-act, 7-scene structure**. This is storytelling, not a feature list. The status quo is the villain, the product is the enabler, and the customer is the hero.

---

## ACT 1: THE WORLD AS IT IS (~800 words)

Emotion: frustration, recognition. The reader should nod and think "that's exactly my life."

### Scene 1: The Status Quo Villain

Name the broken thing everyone accepts but shouldn't. Don't attack a specific competitor — attack the *approach* that the entire industry has normalized. Make it feel like an inevitability that isn't actually inevitable.

### Scene 2: The Human Cost

Make the abstract pain concrete and personal. Show what this broken status quo costs real people — their time, their sleep, their credibility, their sanity. Use specific scenarios, not generalizations. If practitioner quotes are available, this is where they hit hardest.

### Scene 3: Failed Attempts

Show why the problem persists despite previous attempts to solve it. Half-measures, bolt-on fixes, and "next-gen" promises that delivered the same old approach in a new UI. The reader should understand why this problem is *structural*, not just a tooling gap.

---

## ACT 2: THE TURNING POINT (~600 words)

Emotion: hope, a spark of excitement. The reader should lean forward.

### Scene 4: The Insight

The contrarian reframe — a question that changes everything. "What if the problem isn't that we need better X, but that we've been doing X wrong entirely?" This is the moment the narrative pivots. It should feel like an "aha" moment, not a product pitch.

### Scene 5: A Different Approach

What follows logically from the insight. This is where the product enters — not as a hero swooping in, but as the natural consequence of thinking differently. Reference specific capabilities, but frame them as *what becomes possible* when you accept the insight.

---

## ACT 3: THE NEW WORLD (~600 words)

Emotion: excitement, aspiration. The reader should feel the pull of possibility.

### Scene 6: The Transformation

Concrete before/after for the same scenarios from Act 1. The same person who was frustrated in Scene 2 now has a completely different experience. Show the contrast vividly — same trigger, different outcome. This is proof that the insight works.

### Scene 7: The Invitation

Forward-looking vision. Where does this lead? Not a sales pitch — a movement. The reader should feel invited into something bigger than a product. End with the logical consequence: if this approach is right, what does the future look like?

---

## STORY SPINE

Write a single standalone paragraph (3-5 sentences) that captures the entire transformation story using a structure like:

*"Once upon a time, [status quo]. Every day, [human cost]. Until one day, [the insight]. Because of that, [the new approach]. And ever since, [the transformation]."*

This should work as a standalone elevator pitch.

---

## TAGLINES

Generate 5-8 sticky, memorable phrases that capture the transformation. Mix styles:
- Bold declaration (e.g., "Un-carrier: no contracts, ever")
- Contrast pair (e.g., "Less noise. More signal.")
- Question that reframes (e.g., "What if alerts actually told you something?")
- Movement invitation (e.g., "Join the teams who stopped drowning")
- Provocative challenge (e.g., "Your dashboards are lying to you")

## Rules

1. **Status quo is the villain** — never attack a specific competitor by name in the narrative. Attack the *approach*.
2. **Product is enabler, not hero** — the customer's world transforms. The product made it possible. Don't center the product.
3. **Emotional beats are required** — each act must create a distinct emotional state in the reader (frustration → hope → excitement).
4. **Practitioner quotes ground the story** — weave them naturally into scenes, especially Acts 1 and 3.
5. **Every scene advances the narrative** — no filler, no recap, no "let's take a step back." Forward momentum only.
6. **Concrete over abstract** — specific scenarios, real numbers, named roles, actual workflows. Never "organizations struggle with complexity."
7. **Total length: ~2000-2500 words** — plus story spine and taglines.
8. **Use headers as shown** — ACT 1, ACT 2, ACT 3, Scene numbers, STORY SPINE, TAGLINES.
