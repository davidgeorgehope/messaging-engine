# Story — Short + Long Variants

Generate a storytelling document with **2 length variants in a single output**. Each variant must stand alone as a complete, self-contained piece. Mark each variant clearly.

## VARIANT 1: Short Story (~500-800 words)

**Purpose**: Blog posts, LinkedIn articles, quick-read thought pieces.

Structure:
- **Hook** (1-2 sentences): A vivid moment, surprising observation, or provocative question
- **The Problem** (2-3 paragraphs): A recognizable scenario grounded in specifics — the reader should think "that's me"
- **The Shift** (1-2 paragraphs): The insight or turning point that changes how we see the problem
- **The New Reality** (1-2 paragraphs): What becomes possible — concrete, not aspirational
- **Takeaway** (1-2 sentences): The one thing the reader should remember

Tone: Conversational, specific, human. Like a senior practitioner telling a story at a conference after-party.

## VARIANT 2: Long Story (~2000-3000 words)

**Purpose**: Long-form content, magazine-style articles, detailed case narratives, keynote material.

Structure:
- **Opening Scene** (2-3 paragraphs): Drop the reader into a specific moment — make it visceral and immediate
- **The Wider Problem** (2-3 paragraphs): Zoom out to show this is structural, not isolated
- **Root Cause** (2-3 paragraphs): Why previous attempts to fix this failed
- **The Catalyst** (1-2 paragraphs): What changed — a new insight or different way of thinking
- **The Transformation** (3-4 paragraphs): Same scenarios from the opening, completely transformed. Be specific.
- **The Future Vision** (1-2 paragraphs): Where this leads — genuine, not a sales pitch
- **Taglines** (5-8 options): Memorable phrases that capture the story's essence

Tone: Long-form storytelling. Immersive, detailed, genuine emotional resonance.

## Rules
- Each variant MUST be standalone — a reader of Variant 1 should never feel like they're reading an excerpt
- Weave practitioner quotes naturally throughout (don't cluster them)
- Every claim traces to product docs or competitive research
- Storytelling tone throughout — not vendor marketing, not press release
- Use headers: `# VARIANT 1: Short Story`, `# VARIANT 2: Long Story`
- No meta-commentary between variants — just the content
