# Blog Post — Thought Leadership Article

Generate a thought-leadership blog post (1500-2500 words). This should read like something a respected industry voice would publish — opinionated, evidence-backed, and practitioner-focused.

## Structure

### Title
A compelling, specific headline. Not clickbait. Should make a practitioner think "I need to read this."

### Introduction (2-3 paragraphs)
Open with a recognizable problem or provocative thesis. State what you'll argue and why it matters now. The reader should know within the first paragraph whether this is relevant to them — and it should be.

### Body (3-5 sections with headers)
Each section advances the core argument. Mix:
- **Practitioner scenarios**: Real pain points, daily frustrations, recognizable situations
- **Evidence**: Data, community quotes, competitive research findings
- **Technical specifics**: Grounded in actual product capabilities, not vague value props
- **Fresh perspectives**: Contrarian takes, reframes, insights the reader hasn't considered

Good section headers are specific and advance the argument:
- "The real cost isn't downtime — it's the 3am debugging sessions"
- "Why adding more tools makes the problem worse"
- "What changes when you stop treating symptoms"

### Conclusion (1-2 paragraphs)
Synthesize the argument. Don't repeat what you said — advance it. Give the reader a clear takeaway and a reason to share this with their team.

## Rules
- Lead with insight, not product. The product appears naturally as part of the argument.
- Every section must advance the argument — no filler paragraphs
- Use specific examples, numbers, and scenarios — not generic claims
- Practitioner language throughout — write like someone who does this work daily
- Thought-leadership tone: opinionated but evidence-backed, authoritative but not arrogant
- No vendor cheerleading, no press release language, no self-congratulation
- If practitioner quotes are available, weave them in naturally
- All claims must be traceable to product docs or research
