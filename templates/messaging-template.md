# Messaging Template — Comprehensive Positioning Document

Generate a complete messaging positioning document (3000-5000 words). Every section must be filled. This is a single, exhaustive generation — not a summary or outline.

## Required Sections

### 1. BACKGROUND / MARKET TRENDS
2-3 paragraphs grounding the messaging in the current market reality. What has changed? What trends make this product relevant now? Reference specific industry shifts, not generic "digital transformation" claims. Cite competitive research if available.

### 2. KEY MESSAGE
A single headline of 8-12 words. This is the one thing you want every reader to remember. It should be pain-first, specific, and immediately recognizable to a practitioner.

Provide 2-3 alternative headlines with brief rationale for each.

### 3. SUB-HEAD
A supporting line (15-25 words) that bridges the headline to specifics. Provide 2-3 alternatives.

### 4. CUSTOMER PROMISES
3-4 promise blocks. Each block contains:
- **Promise Name**: 2-4 word label (e.g., "Instant Root Cause", "Zero Pipeline Tax")
- **Tagline**: 1 sentence making the promise concrete
- **Description**: 2-3 paragraphs explaining what this means in practice, what changes for the practitioner, and how the product delivers on this promise. Reference specific capabilities from the product docs.

### 5. PROOF POINTS
1 proof point per customer promise. Each must be:
- Grounded in the product documentation or competitive research
- Specific (numbers, capability names, architecture details)
- Verifiable — a practitioner could confirm this by trying the product

### 6. PRIORITY USE CASES
3-5 use cases, each with:
- **Scenario**: A specific situation practitioners face (1-2 sentences)
- **Current Pain**: What happens today without this product (1-2 sentences)
- **With Product**: What changes (1-2 sentences referencing specific capabilities)

### 7. OTHER THINGS TO KNOW
Bullet list of 4-6 additional facts, capabilities, or differentiators that don't fit neatly into promises but matter to practitioners evaluating the product.

### 8. PROBLEM STATEMENT
2-3 paragraphs articulating the core problem from the practitioner's perspective. This should read like a senior engineer venting in a Slack channel. If practitioner quotes are available, use them.

### 9. DESCRIPTIONS
- **Short** (10 words): For tweets, tags, one-line mentions
- **Medium** (25 words): For email subject lines, card descriptions, brief mentions
- **Long** (100+ words): For landing pages, collateral intros, detailed descriptions

### 10. CUSTOMER PROOF POINTS
If competitive research or practitioner quotes are available, include 3-5 real or realistic proof points — things a customer might say about this product or problem space. Format as direct quotes with role attribution.

## Rules
- 3000-5000 words total — fill every section completely
- ALL claims must trace to the product documentation or competitive research
- No invented features, no aspirational claims, no roadmap items
- Write like a senior PMM who has read every doc and talked to practitioners
- If you don't have enough source material for a section, say so explicitly rather than inventing content
