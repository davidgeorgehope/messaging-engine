# Social Hook Template

## Format
Generate a short-form social media post (LinkedIn/Twitter style) that hooks practitioners with a relatable pain point.

## Structure

### Hook Line
[1 sentence, max 15 words. Must stop the scroll. Pain-first, relatable, specific.]

### Expansion
[2-3 sentences expanding on the pain with a specific scenario or stat. Feel genuine and conversational.]

### Pivot
[1 sentence connecting to a better way. Not a product pitch — more like sharing a lesson learned.]

### CTA (Optional)
[1 sentence question or invitation. Encourages engagement, not clicks.]

## Examples of Good Hooks
- "Your alert fired 47 times this week. Only 3 needed action."
- "Spent 40 minutes this morning switching between 6 tabs to debug one issue."
- "Your monitoring bill went up 3x. Your MTTR stayed the same."

## Rules
- Total length: 280-500 characters (LinkedIn) or under 280 (Twitter)
- NO hashtag spam. Max 2 hashtags if any.
- Sound like a practitioner sharing frustration, not a brand posting content
- No "We're excited to share..." or similar corporate openings
- The best social hooks get replies like "THIS" or "felt this in my soul"
