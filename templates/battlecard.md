# Battlecard Section Template

## Format
Generate a competitive battlecard section for a specific practitioner pain point.

## Structure

### Pain Point
[1-2 sentences describing the specific pain from the practitioner's perspective. Use their actual words if quotes are available.]

### Our Approach
[2-3 sentences on how our product specifically addresses this pain. Reference concrete capabilities, not generic claims. Connect each capability to the pain.]

### Competitive Landscape
[For each relevant competitor:]
- **[Competitor Name]**: [1-2 sentences on their approach to this pain, their strengths, and their gaps]

### Why We Win
[2-3 bullet points with specific, defensible differentiators for THIS pain point. Not generic differentiators — specific to the scenario described.]

### Talk Track Snippet
> [2-3 sentence script a field team member could use verbatim when this pain comes up in conversation. Should sound natural, not scripted.]

### Trap Question
> "[A question to ask the prospect that exposes competitor weakness for this specific pain point, without being obviously adversarial]"

## Rules
- Every claim must trace to research, product docs, or practitioner quotes
- Lead with the pain, not with our product
- Be honest about competitor strengths — credibility > positioning
- The talk track should sound like a human, not a battlecard
