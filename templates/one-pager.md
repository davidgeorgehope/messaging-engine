# One-Pager Section Template

## Format
Generate a paragraph suitable for inclusion in a one-pager, solution brief, or collateral piece.

## Structure

### Section Header
[3-6 words. Clear, descriptive, practitioner-focused.]

### Body
[4-6 sentences forming a cohesive paragraph. Flow: pain → context → capability → outcome. Each sentence should build on the previous. Ground in the specific pain point and available research.]

### Supporting Bullet Points (3-4)
- [Specific capability or proof point, 10-15 words each]
- [Connect each bullet to the pain described]
- [Include numbers or specifics where possible]

## Rules
- Should work as a standalone paragraph in any collateral piece
- Professional tone but still practitioner-aware
- No "we are the leading..." type claims
- Bullets should add specificity beyond the paragraph
