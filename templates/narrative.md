# Narrative — Multi-Length Storytelling Document

Generate a storytelling narrative document with **3 length variants in a single output**. Each variant must stand alone as a complete, self-contained piece. Mark each variant clearly.

---

## VARIANT 1: Executive Summary (~250 words)

**Purpose**: Board decks, executive briefs, analyst summaries.

Structure:
- **Thesis** (1-2 sentences): The core argument — what's broken and why it matters now
- **Problem** (2-3 sentences): The practitioner reality, grounded in specifics
- **Vision** (2-3 sentences): What becomes possible with this product, referencing concrete capabilities

Tone: Authoritative, concise, every word earns its place. No filler.

---

## VARIANT 2: Conference Talk (~1000 words)

**Purpose**: Keynote scripts, webinar intros, thought-leadership blog posts.

Structure:
- **Hook** (1-2 paragraphs): Open with a recognizable practitioner scenario or provocative observation
- **The Problem** (2-3 paragraphs): Why the current approach is failing — be specific about what practitioners experience daily
- **Why It Fails** (1-2 paragraphs): Root cause analysis — not surface symptoms but structural reasons
- **The Vision** (2-3 paragraphs): What a different approach looks like, grounded in specific product capabilities
- **Taglines** (3-5 options): Memorable phrases that capture the narrative's thesis

Tone: Thought-leadership — someone who has earned the right to have an opinion.

## VARIANT 3: Full Narrative (~2500 words)

**Purpose**: Long-form content, positioning documents, detailed thought-leadership pieces.

Structure:
- **Thesis**: The central argument in 2-3 sentences
- **The Broken Promise**: What the industry promised practitioners and how it fell short (2-3 paragraphs)
- **Life in the Trenches**: What practitioners actually deal with daily — use quotes if available, paint specific scenarios (3-4 paragraphs)

- **A New Approach**: How this product rethinks the problem from first principles — reference specific architecture decisions and capabilities (3-4 paragraphs)
- **What Changes**: Concrete before/after scenarios showing practitioner impact (2-3 paragraphs)
- **The Future**: Where this leads — not vaporware roadmap, but the logical consequence of this approach (1-2 paragraphs)
- **Taglines**: 5-8 options ranging from bold to understated

Tone: Long-form thought leadership. The reader should feel like they're reading something written by someone who deeply understands their world.

## Rules
- Each variant MUST be standalone — a reader of Variant 1 should never feel like they're reading an excerpt
- Weave practitioner quotes naturally throughout (don't cluster them)
- Every claim traces to product docs or competitive research
- Thought-leadership tone throughout — not vendor marketing, not press release
- Use headers: `# VARIANT 1: Executive Summary`, `# VARIANT 2: Conference Talk`, `# VARIANT 3: Full Narrative`
- No meta-commentary between variants — just the content
