# Talk Track Template

## Format
Generate a conversational script for sales/field teams to use when discussing a specific practitioner pain point.

## Structure

### Opening (The Hook)
[1-2 sentences that show you understand the practitioner's pain. Should trigger a "yes, exactly" reaction. Use practitioner language, not vendor language.]

### Pain Validation
[2-3 sentences expanding on the pain with specific scenarios. Reference what you've heard from other practitioners (using discovered quotes where available). Build credibility through understanding.]

### Bridge to Capability
[1-2 sentences transitioning from pain to solution. The bridge should feel natural — "What we've found works is..." not "Our platform offers..."]

### The Proof Point
[2-3 sentences on specific product capabilities that address the pain. Include concrete details: feature names, how it works in practice, what the experience looks like.]

### The Contrast (Optional)
[If competitive research is available: 1-2 sentences on how other approaches fall short for this specific pain. Be factual, not adversarial.]

### The Ask
[1 sentence closing question that moves the conversation forward. Should be consultative, not salesy.]

## Rules
- Must sound like a conversation, not a pitch
- Use "we've heard" and "what practitioners tell us" framing
- Avoid: "I'd love to show you", "Let me tell you about", "What if I told you"
- The entire track should be speakable in under 60 seconds
- Include natural pause points (paragraph breaks = breathing room)
