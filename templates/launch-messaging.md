# Launch Messaging Template

## Format
Generate headline + subhead + body messaging for product launch materials related to a specific pain point.

## Structure

### Headline
[8-12 words. Problem-first, not product-first. Should be immediately recognizable to someone experiencing this pain.]

### Subheadline
[15-25 words. Bridges the pain to the solution. More specific than headline.]

### Body (3 paragraphs)

**Paragraph 1 — The Pain:**
[3-4 sentences establishing the pain with specificity and practitioner language. Ground it in real scenarios and quotes.]

**Paragraph 2 — The Approach:**
[3-4 sentences on how the product addresses this pain. Concrete capabilities, not abstract value. Connect each point to the pain described above.]

**Paragraph 3 — The Outcome:**
[2-3 sentences on what changes for the practitioner. What does their day look like after? Be specific about the improvement.]

## Rules
- Headline is the most important element — spend the most effort here
- No superlatives in the headline or subheadline
- Body should build on source practitioner quotes and competitive research
- The "outcome" paragraph should describe the practitioner's improved experience, not product metrics
